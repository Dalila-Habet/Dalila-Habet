Hey there fellow developers and GitHub enthusiasts,

I'm Dalilah Habet, I've always been a curious soul who can't help but daydream about all the possibilities especially that coding and technology have to offer. From web development to AI, it's like a whole universe of creativity out there, waiting to be explored.

As a student, I'm here to soak up all the knowledge I can get my hands on. Learning is an adventure, and GitHub seems like the perfect treasure trove of wisdom. I can't wait to make cool stuff, collaborate with like-minded folks, and just have a blast while doing it!

So, let's embark on this journey ! ðŸš€
